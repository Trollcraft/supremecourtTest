# supremecourtTest
Important Note!!!
I had to remove electron to upload it to GitHub so you need to reinstall it in order for it to work.
This is my first programming project so I am open for any advice to improve my programming skills.


This is going to be a test for people to take in which they can enter their own opinion on different supreme court cases and
get a result which states which supreme court justice most closely reflects their own opinion.


I now mostly need help adding supreme court cases and making everything more beautiful.
To add court cases you just need to open the file testpage.js and scroll down to the questions you can edit everything online.
There you can add more cases using the same structure I used for the first one. Thank you for your help!

After 50 added cases and a more polished UI am i going publish the first release for everyone to download and update it regularly
