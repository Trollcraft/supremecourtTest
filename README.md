# supremecourtTest
Important Note!!!
I had to remove electron to upload it to GitHub so you need to reinstall it in order for it to work.
This is my first programming project so I am open for any advice to improve my programming skills.


This is going to be a test for people to take in which they can enter their own opinion on different supreme court cases and
get a result which states which supreme court justice most closely reflects their own opinion.


I now mostly need help adding supreme court cases and making everything more beautiful.
